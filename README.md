# GrantX-API
API for GrantX plugin.

## Usage
### Private Plugins and GrantX Buyers
Import the actual plugin you download from SpigotMC or MC-Market. DO NOT include the API in your compiled JAR or shade it inside your plugin!

### Public Plugins or Developers Without GrantX
Import the JAR (on Releases page) into your IDE. DO NOT include the API in your compiled JAR or shade it inside your plugin! The server must be running an actual version of GrantX or this API will not do anything (hence why it is called a dummy).

## Version Usage
GrantX versions below 2.0.0 do not have an API. Use the following API versions for GrantX versions 2.0.0 and above:<br>
* API v1.0.0 - GrantX 2.0.0 and higher.
